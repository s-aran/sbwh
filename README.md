# Getting Started

1. Get the webhook URL that can be received from webhook.site
1. Prepare `.sbwhrc.toml`. Place it in the same directory as the executable file.
    ```
    # sample .sbwhrc.toml

    [webhook_site]
    # !!sorry, https is NOT supported (support in the future)!!
    url = "http://webhook.site/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

    [webhook_site.payload]
    value = "Hello {{hello}}"

    [webhook_site.mustache]
    hello = "World"
    ```
1. Run
    ```
    ./sbwh webhook_site
    ```

    ```
    {
      "value": "Hello World"
    }
    ```
